          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

<h2><u>Structure of HTML</u></h2>
<p> 
The structure of an HTML document is made up of a document type declaration, a root element, and nested elements called the head and body<br>

<b>1.Document type declaration</b>:The document type declaration for HTML5 <br>

<b>2.Root element</b>:The root element of an HTML document is the <html> element<br>

<b>3.Head</b>:The head of the document contains meta information, such as search engine<br>
<b>4.Body</b>:The body of the document contains the content of the page, such as text
</p>
<h2><u>Types of HTML Tags</h2></u>
<p>
There are two types of Html tags<br>

<b>Paired tags</b>: Require an opening tag and a closing tag to turn a formatting feature on and off<br>
<b>Unpaired tags</b>:: Work alone and are usually placed before the text you want formatted<br>
</p>
<h2><u>Elements of Html</h2></u> 
<p>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, and include the body, head, DOCTYPE, headings, and inline elements.<br>
<b>Inline elements</b>:Modify the content inside a line, rather than forming new blocks of content<br>
<b>Title</b>:Defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab
The title must be text-only
